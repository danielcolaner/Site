                19-year-old American organist Daniel Colaner captured international media attention at the age of 12 with his same-day performances on piano at Carnegie Hall and on organ at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Since then, his talents have been showcased on <i>ABC World News Tonight</i>, <i>Good Morning America</i>, <i>The Harry (Connick Jr.) Show</i>, and the BBC World Service <i>Newsday</i>. Daniel has been featured on the NPR radio show From the Top (Show #377), performing "Jupiter" from Gustav Holst's The Planets, and on PBS with the American Pops Orchestra in One Voice: The Songs We Share–The Sacred. In 2023, he made his orchestral debut with Joseph Jongen's Symphonie Concertante under Carlos Kalmar.

                In 2021, he was chosen for The Diapason magazine's "20 Under 30," a select group of young adults at the forefront of the organ field. He was a 2023 National YoungArts Winner with Distinction in Organ/Classical Music and the recipient of the prestigious Jack Kent Cooke Young Artist Award in 2020. As the recipient of a 2023 Anthony Quinn Foundation Scholarship, Daniel had the opportunity to perform on the great organs of Paris during the summer of 2023. He is winner of the 2024 M. Louise Miller-Paul E. Knox Scholarship Competition sponsored by the Greater Bridgeport Chapter of the American Guild of Organists and the Bart Pitman Memorial Music Scholarship sponsored by the Delaware Valley Music Club.

            <p>
                Daniel has been the 1st Prize winner at numerous organ competitions, including the Arthur Poister Organ Competition, the Albert Schweitzer Organ Competition (HS Division), the National High School Organ Competition, the David Dubois Organ Competition, the L. Cameron Johnson Organ Competition, the East Carolina University Organ Competition, the Columbia AGO Organ Competition, and the Sursa American Organ Competition (HS Division). He received 2nd Prize and the Bach Prize this year in the Senior Category of the Northern Ireland International Organ Competition, in addition to future concert engagements at St. Paul's Cathedral, London, New College, Oxford, Manchester Cathedral, and at the St. Albans International Organ Festival. In the past year, his busy concert schedule included the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, a solo recital on the Setnor Guest Artist Series at Syracuse University, and a sesquicentennial celebration concert at The Shrine Church of St. Stanislaus in Slavic Village, Cleveland, Ohio.

                Also an accomplished pianist, Daniel has been a laureate of the American Protégé Piano Competition, the Steinway Junior Piano Competition, and The American Prize Lorin Hollander Concerto Competition. In 2022, he made his Severance Hall debut with the Cleveland Pops Orchestra, performing Nikolai Kapustin's Piano Concerto No. 2, and has performed Saint-Saëns' Piano Concerto No. 2 with the Euclid, Lakeland, and Suburban Symphony Orchestras. An avid collaborative pianist and chamber musician, his Meraki Trio was awarded 1st Prize at the inaugural Glass City Chamber Music Competition and was one of four piano trios to advance to the semi-final round of the 2023 Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition.

                Daniel's journey into classical music began as a form of cognitive therapy during his battle with stage IV neuroblastoma as an infant, unleashing his passion for the piano at age 5 and organ at age 10. Since his early teens, he has promoted the benefits of classical music on both radio and television and has helped raise thousands of dollars for non-profit organizations that support music therapy and music education.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Daniel has been employed as the Organ Scholar at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Cleveland Heights and served as the Organ Scholar at the 2024 RSCM Washington, DC Choral Residency. He completed his pre-collegiate music studies at the Cleveland Institute of Music and as a private organ student of David Higgs at the Eastman Community Music School. He is looking forward to making Philadelphia his home for the next four years where he will be serving as the Organ Scholar at the Episcopal Church of The Redeemer in Bryn Mawr, PA, and as a Wanamaker Assistant Grand Court Organist at Macy's Center City, while pursuing a Bachelor of Music Degree in Organ at the Curtis Institute of Music.
