                American organist Daniel Colaner first captured international media attention at the age of 12 with his same-day performances on piano at Carnegie Hall and on organ at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Since then, his talents have been showcased on <i>ABC World News Tonight</i>, <i>Good Morning America</i>, <i>The Harry (Connick Jr.) Show</i>, and the BBC World Service <i>Newsday</i>. He has been featured on the NPR radio show <i>From the Top (Show #377)</i>, performing "Jupiter" from Gustav Holst's <i>The Planets</i>, and on PBS with the American Pops Orchestra in <i>One Voice: The Songs We Share – The Sacred.</i> In 2023, he made his orchestral debut with Joseph Jongen's <i>Symphonie Concertante</i> under Carlos Kalmar.

                A member of The Diapason magazine's "20 Under 30" Class of 2021, he was a 2023 National YoungArts Winner with Distinction in Organ/Classical Music and the recipient of the prestigious Jack Kent Cooke Young Artist Award. He has been a top prize winner at numerous organ competitions, including the Arthur Poister Organ Competition and the Albert Schweitzer Organ Competition (HS Division). His recent success at the Northern Ireland International Organ Competition also garnered him the Bach Prize as well as future engagements at St. Paul's Cathedral, London, New College, Oxford, Manchester Cathedral, and a Bach Corner concert at the St. Albans International Organ Festival.

                Also an accomplished pianist, Daniel has been a laureate of the American Protégé Piano Competition and The American Prize Lorin Hollander Concerto Competition. In 2022, he made his Severance Hall debut with the Cleveland Pops Orchestra, performing Nikolai Kapustin's <i>Piano Concerto No. 2</i>, and has performed Saint-Saëns' <i>Piano Concerto No. 2</i> with the Euclid, Lakeland, and Suburban Symphony Orchestras. An avid collaborative pianist and chamber musician, his Meraki Trio was awarded 1st Prize at the inaugural Glass City Chamber Music Competition and was one of four piano trios to advance to the semi-final round of the 2023 Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition.

                Daniel's exposure to music began as cognitive therapy during his battle with stage IV neuroblastoma as an infant, unleashing his passion for the piano at age 5 and organ at age 10. He has been a promoter of classical music on both radio and television and has helped raise thousands of dollars for non-profit organizations that support music therapy and music education. A dedicated church musician, he has served as the Organ Scholar at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Cleveland, OH, St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Cleveland Heights, and for the RSCM Washington, DC Choral Residency.

            <p>
                He completed his pre-collegiate music studies at the Cleveland Institute of Music and as a student of David Higgs at the Eastman Community Music School. He is looking forward to making Philadelphia his home for the next four years where he will be serving as the Organ Scholar at the Episcopal Church of The Redeemer in Bryn Mawr, PA, and as a Wanamaker Assistant Grand Court Organist at Macy's Center City, while pursuing a Bachelor of Music Degree in Organ at the Curtis Institute of Music with Alan Morrison, through the generosity of the Dr. Mi Wha Lee Fellowship.
