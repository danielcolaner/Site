                Daniel's journey into classical music began as a form of cognitive therapy during his battle with stage IV neuroblastoma as an infant, unleashing his passion for the piano at age 6 and organ at age 10. Since his early teens, he has promoted the benefits of classical music on both radio and television and has helped raise thousands of dollars for non-profit organizations that support music therapy and music education.

                Daniel has been employed as the Organ Scholar at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Cleveland Heights and served as the Organ Scholar at the 2024 RSCM Washington, DC Choral Residency. He completed his pre-collegiate music studies at the Cleveland Institute of Music and as a private organ student of David Higgs at the Eastman Community Music School. He is looking forward to making Philadelphia his home for the next four years where he will be serving as the Organ Scholar at the Episcopal Church of The Redeemer in Bryn Mawr, PA, and as a Wanamaker Assistant Grand Court Organist at Macy's Center City, while pursuing a Bachelor of Music Degree in Organ at the Curtis Institute of Music.
